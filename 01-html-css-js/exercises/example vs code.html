    /* ============================================
       ALTERNATIVE APPROACH: USING A CLASS
       ============================================
       
       Instead of styling all spans, it's better practice to use a class.
       This way, if you add other spans later, they won't inherit these styles.
       
       You would change <span> to <span class="highlight"> in HTML,
       and change the CSS selector from "span" to ".highlight":
       
       .highlight {
         color: beige;
         letter-spacing: 0.5px;
         font-weight: 700;
         font-size: 30px;
